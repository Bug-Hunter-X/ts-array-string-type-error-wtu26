This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when passing an array to a function that expects a string argument.  The `greeter` function is designed to accept a single string, but in the code, an array is passed as an argument. This results in a type error. The solution involves modifying the function or the way the array is handled to ensure type compatibility.
